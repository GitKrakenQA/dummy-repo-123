   Stack around the variable ' ' was corrupted.    The variable '  ' is being used without being initialized.                                      The value of ESP was not properly saved across a function call.  This is usually a result of calling a function declared with one calling convention with a function pointer declared with a different calling convention.

                                                    A cast to a smaller data type has caused a loss of data.  If this was intentional, you should mask the source of the cast with the appropriate bitmask.  For example:

	char c = (i & 0xFF);

Changing the code in this way will not affect the quality of the resulting optimized code.
